I have a passion for utilizing statistical models and optimization techniques in data analysis to draw meaningful conclusions. My background in statistics and computer programming has enabled me to derive predictive inferences from data and effectively approach associated problems. I am familiar with statistical modeling concepts such as Regression Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Experimental Design, and Statistical Testing. I also have a strong understanding of Operations Research and Linear Programming.

I have the most experience using SQL, Tableau, R programming, and Python. I am currently taking courses on DataCamp to master these tools and further develop my skills as a Data Scientist.

I graduated in May 2023 from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a concentration in statistics (GPA: 4.0). I have developed my experience in statistical data analysis and programming through research such as identifying differentially expressed genes through Poisson-Tweedie modeling, exploring variable selection methods in logistic regression, and developing my own simplex algorithm software in Python! I served as the 2021-2022 President and Co-Founder of the Undergraduate Mathematics Club at UNCC. I also tutored for a course in operations research (Deterministic Modeling) during the spring semester of 2023.
