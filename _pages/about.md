I am a Marketing Systems Analyst at Packaging Corporation of America. PCA is the third largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in North America. I work with our Strategic Insights Team to analyze survey data from our Employee & Customer Engagement surveys. We share the results of our analyses internally with plant management and sales teams across our network to enhance customer experience and optimize plant operations. Additionally, I develop Power BI dashboards to summarize the business performance of various national accounts.

I have a bachelor's degree in mathematics with a concentration in statistics from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. My passion lies in leveraging statistical analysis and visualization to uncover data patterns and identify opportunities for improvement. As an undergraduate, I actively pursued independent research opportunities with professors to explore topics beyond the scope of my coursework. These areas included regression analysis, time series analysis, k-means clustering, and significance testing. I served as the 2021-2022 President of the Mathematics Club at UNC Charlotte. I also tutored for a course in deterministic modeling during my spring semester of 2023.

Technichal Skills: Python, Tableau, Power BI, SQL, R
