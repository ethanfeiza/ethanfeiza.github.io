I have a passion for leveraging statistical analysis and visualization to explore patterns in data. As an undergraduate, I actively pursued independent research opportunities with professors to explore topics beyond the scope of my coursework. These areas included regression analysis, time series analysis, k-means clustering, and significance testing.

I am most experienced using SQL, Tableau, R, and Python in my analysis projects.

I served as the 2021-2022 President of the Mathematics Club at UNC Charlotte. I also tutored for a course in deterministic modeling during the spring semester of 2023.
