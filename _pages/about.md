I have a passion for leveraging statistical analysis and visualization to explore patterns in data. As an undergraduate, I actively pursued independent research opportunities with professors to explore topics beyond the scope of my coursework. These areas included regression analysis, time series analysis, k-means clustering, and significance testing.

I am most experienced using SQL, Tableau, R, and Python in my analysis projects.

I utilized statistical data analysis and programming throughout my undergraduate research at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte. These projects required identifying differentially expressed genes through Poisson-Tweedie modeling, exploring variable selection methods in logistic regression, and developing my own simplex algorithm in Python! I served as the 2021-2022 President of the Mathematics Club at UNCC. I also tutored for a Deterministic Modeling course during my spring semester of 2023.
