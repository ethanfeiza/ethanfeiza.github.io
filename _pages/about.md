I have a passion for applying statistical techniques in data analysis to draw meaningful conclusions. My background in statistics and programming enables me to effectively approach problems and extract data-driven insights. I am familiar with statistical modeling concepts like Regression Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Clustering, and Significance Testing. I also have a strong understanding of Optimization in Operations Research and Linear Programming.

I have the most experience using SQL, Tableau, R, and Python in analysis. I am currently taking courses on DataCamp to further develop my skills as a Data Scientist.

I have implemented statistical analyses and programming throughout my undergraduate research. Some of these projects include identifying differentially expressed genes through Poisson-Tweedie modeling, exploring variable selection methods in logistic regression, and developing my own simplex algorithm software in Python! I served as the 2021-2022 President of the Mathematics Club at UNCC. I also tutored for a Deterministic Modeling course during my spring semester of 2023.
