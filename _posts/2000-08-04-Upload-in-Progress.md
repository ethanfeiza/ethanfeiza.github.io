## Background
There are plenty of methods that can be used to forecast time series data. The characteristics of your data can help guide your choice, but it's important to acknowledge that every model will have strengths and limitations.

Traditional models like ARIMA and exponential smoothing have been widely used for decades due to their robustness and simplicity. However, new advancements in modeling can offer fresh perspectives by simplifying implementation and improving performance on complex data.

In this project, we'll explore traditional time series forecasting methods and compare them to Facebook's 2017 Prophet model. We will assess model diagnostics and accuracy between these approaches while considering the potential drawbacks of different models. Lastly, we'll take a deep dive into the features of the Facebook Prophet model package in RStudio.
