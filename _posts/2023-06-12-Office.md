## Background

This analysis comes from an unguided project offered by DataCamp. In this project, I utilize the `Pandas` and `Matplotlib` libraries to create an informative plot of episode data from The Office. The dataset used in this analysis comes from the Kaggle data science community. 

## Analysis

To begin this project, we can download the `pandas` and `Matplotlib` packages and alias them accordingly. We also need to import the CSV file containing the episode data. Once this is accomplished, we can take a look at the first few rows of our dataset.

```python
### Import packages
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

### Preview the data
data = pd.read_csv('datasets/office_episodes.csv')
data.head()
```
