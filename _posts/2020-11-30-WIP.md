## Background
Kooth is a free online mental health service for individuals aged 11-25 years old. Service users can access an online chatroom feature allowing them to speak with trained mental health counselers. 

Kooth has provided two datasets containing information on service user activity within this chatroom feature. This data was collected during the week of April 13th, 2020. All service users in this data are located within the United States. 

We have been asked to investigate trends in service user behavior regarding chat attempts, queue wait times, and queue success rates. 

## Data Cleansing
Python and SQL code will be executed using an IPython kernel in Jupyter Notebook. 

To begin, we will load the required Python libraries and import the two datasets provided by Kooth.

```python
