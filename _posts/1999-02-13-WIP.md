## Background
When creating a discrete predictive model, intuition may lead us to believe that more features equals stronger results. A powerful neural network might require an extensive feature set and rich history to predict an accurate output. However, this is not always necessary to achieve the desired result.

A *stochastic process* describes a system where state changes are driven by probability. The process follows an assumption known as the *Markov Property*: the next state of the system depends only on the current state, not the sequence of prior states that led to the current. This idea forms a core framework in probabilistic modeling.

A *Markov Chain* is a mathematical model that uses this property to predict the next state of a system given only its current state. Despite its simplicity requiring no memory of past states, this approach can prove powerful across many applications, like natural language processing or predicting how users navigate websites.

## The Basics of a Markov Chain

Before we dive into a real-world application of a Markov Chain, let's familiarize ourselves with some basic concepts. For any stochastic process, we must define a *State Space*: a complete set of states covering all possible system outcomes. For example, we can define a system with three states. The state space S = {S~1~, S~2~, S~3~}.
