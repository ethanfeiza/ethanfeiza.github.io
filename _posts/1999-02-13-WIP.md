## Background
If I asked you to consider how to best model a process heavily influenced by uncertainty, your intuition might say that *more is better*. A large feature set, deep historical recognition, and sensitivity to intricate patterns could seem like the path to accuracy. After all, more signal should lead to stronger predictive performance, right?
A stochastic process—one involving randomness and probabilistic transitions between states—seems to demand this complexity. And sure, for time series forecasting or complex system modeling, that might be true. But at what cost? Computational expense, limited data, and the curse of dimensionality can all lead us astray.
What if there were a modeling approach that could be both simpler and more effective? Let's dive into the world of Markov Chain modeling!
