## Background and Analysis

This project is accessible on DataCamp upon completing of the Intermediate Python course. The goal of this analysis is to determine whether there has been a decline in the average duration of movies available on the Netflix platform. To accomplish this, I employ data manipulation techniques to analyze movie duration trends between 2011 and 2020.
I explore the Pandas and Matplotlib packages in Python to visualize my results.

To begin this project, I create a dictionary from two lists consisting of movie release years and corresponding average movie durations.

```python
# Create the years and durations lists
years = list(range(2011, 2021, 1))
durations = [103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, 90]

# Create a dictionary with the two lists
movie_dict={'years':years, 'durations': durations}
```

Next, I import the Pandas library to create a dataframe from this dictionary. I also import the Matplotlib.pyplot library to visualize any potential trend between the two fields in the new dataframe.

```python
# Import pandas under its usual alias
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from the dictionary
durations_df = pd.DataFrame(movie_dict)

# Print the DataFrame
print(durations_df)
```

| years | durations |
| :-- | --: |
| 0   2011 | 103 |
| 1   2012 | 101 |
| 2   2013 | 99 |
| 3   2014 | 100 |
| 4   2015 | 100 |
| 5   2016 | 95 |
| 6   2017 | 95 |
| 7   2018 | 96 |
| 8   2019 | 93 |
| 9   2020 | 90 |
