## Background and Analysis

This project is accessible on DataCamp upon completing of the Intermediate Python course. The goal of this analysis is to determine whether there has been a decline in the average duration of movies available on the Netflix platform. To accomplish this, I employ data manipulation techniques to analyze movie duration trends between 2011 and 2020.
I explore the Pandas and Matplotlib packages in Python to visualize my results.

To begin this project, I create a dictionary from two lists consisting of movie release years and corresponding average movie durations.

```python
# Create the years and durations lists
years = list(range(2011, 2021, 1))
durations = [103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, 90]

# Create a dictionary with the two lists
movie_dict={'years':years, 'durations': durations}
```

Next, I import the Pandas library to create a dataframe from this dictionary. I also import the Matplotlib.pyplot library to visualize any potential trend between the two fields in the new dataframe.

```python
# Import pandas under its usual alias
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from the dictionary
durations_df = pd.DataFrame(movie_dict)

# Print the DataFrame
print(durations_df)
```

           years  durations
        0   2011        103
        1   2012        101
        2   2013         99
        3   2014        100
        4   2015        100
        5   2016         95
        6   2017         95
        7   2018         96
        8   2019         93
        9   2020         90

```python
# Import matplotlib.pyplot under its usual alias and create a figure
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig = plt.figure()

# Draw a line plot of release_years and durations
plt.plot(durations_df.years, durations_df.durations)

# Create a title
plt.title("Netflix Movie Durations 2011-2020")

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

While there are only 10 observations in the visual, we have reason to believe there may be a negative trend between release year and movie duration. To begin this analysis, we can investigate a larger CSV file containing information on 7787 movies released between 2011 and 2020 with 10 informative field variables.

```python
# Read in the CSV as a DataFrame
netflix_df = pd.read_csv("datasets/netflix_data.csv")

# Print the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(netflix_df.head(5))
```

Looking at the `type` field, we can see there are also TV shows included in this data set. We can create a new DataFrame `netflix_movies` containing only `title`, `country`, `genre`, `release_year`, and `duration`.

```python
# Subset the DataFrame for type "Movie"
netflix_df_movies_only = netflix_df[netflix_df['type'] == 'Movie']

# Select only the columns of interest
netflix_movies_col_subset = netflix_df_movies_only[['title', 'country', 'genre', 'release_year','duration']]

# Print the first five rows of the new DataFrame
netflix_movies_col_subset.head(5)
```

| title |	country |	genre |	release_year |	duration |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 7:19 |	Mexico |	Dramas |	2016 |	93 |
| 23:59 |	Singapore |	Horror Movies |	2011 |	78 |
| 9 |	United States |	Action |	2009 |	80 |
| 21 |	United States |	Dramas |	2008 |	123 |
| 122 |	Egypt |	Horror Movies |	2019 |	95 |

We can now create a scatter plot visualizing movie duration over a longer range of time.

```python
# Create a figure and increase the figure size
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))

# Create a scatter plot of duration versus year
plt.scatter(netflix_movies_col_subset.release_year, netflix_movies_col_subset.duration)

# Create a title
plt.title('Movie Duration by Year of Release')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

This visual is much more informative than the first line plot. While newer movies on Netflix are overrepresented, we can see that many short movies have been released over the past two decades. Additionally, many of these movies have been well over an hour long. To investigate which films have been lowering the average movie duration over the past two decades, we can filter the dataframe by genre and movie duration subceeding 60 minutes.

```python
# Filter for durations shorter than 60 minutes
short_movies = netflix_movies_col_subset[netflix_movies_col_subset.duration < 60]

# Print the first 20 rows of short_movies
short_movies.head(20)
```

Many of the movies that are less than 60 minutes long belong to genres like "Children", "Stand-Up", and "Documentaries". This is a reasonable finding as one might expect these genres to have shorter runtimes when compared to 90-minute Hollywood blockbusters. We can explore how these genres may affect movie duration by changing their color in the scatter plot. 

```python
# Define an empty list
colors = []

# Iterate over rows of netflix_movies_col_subset
for index, row in netflix_movies_col_subset.iterrows() :
    if row['genre'] == 'Children' :
        colors.append('red')
    elif row['genre'] == 'Documentaries' :
        colors.append('blue')
    elif row['genre'] == 'Stand-Up' :
        colors.append('green')

    else:
        colors.append('black')

# Set the figure style and initalize a new figure
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))

# Create a scatter plot of duration versus release_year
plt.scatter(netflix_movies_col_subset.release_year, netflix_movies_col_subset.duration, c=colors)

# Create a title and axis labels
plt.title('Movie duration by year of release')
plt.xlabel('Release year')
plt.ylabel('Duration (min)')

# Show the plot
plt.show
```
