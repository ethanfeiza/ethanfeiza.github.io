## Background and Analysis

This project is accessible on DataCamp upon completing of the Intermediate Python course. The goal of this analysis is to determine whether there has been a decline in the average duration of movies available on the Netflix platform. To accomplish this, I employ data manipulation techniques to analyze movie duration trends between 2011 and 2020.
I explore the Pandas and Matplotlib packages in Python to visualize my results.

To begin this project, I create a dictionary from two lists consisting of movie release years and corresponding average movie durations.

```python
# Create the years and durations lists
years = list(range(2011, 2021, 1))
durations = [103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, 90]

# Create a dictionary with the two lists
movie_dict={'years':years, 'durations': durations}
```

Next, I import the Pandas library to create a dataframe from this dictionary. I also import the Matplotlib.pyplot library to visualize any potential trend between the two fields in the new dataframe.

```python
# Import pandas under its usual alias
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from the dictionary
durations_df = pd.DataFrame(movie_dict)

# Print the DataFrame
print(durations_df)
```

           years  durations
        0   2011        103
        1   2012        101
        2   2013         99
        3   2014        100
        4   2015        100
        5   2016         95
        6   2017         95
        7   2018         96
        8   2019         93
        9   2020         90

```python
# Import matplotlib.pyplot under its usual alias and create a figure
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig = plt.figure()

# Draw a line plot of release_years and durations
plt.plot(durations_df.years, durations_df.durations)

# Create a title
plt.title("Netflix Movie Durations 2011-2020")

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

While there are only 10 observations in the visual, we have reason to believe there may be a negative trend between release year and movie duration. To expand on this analysis, we can investigate a larger CSV file containing Netflix data.

```python
# Read in the CSV as a DataFrame
netflix_df = pd.read_csv("datasets/netflix_data.csv")

# Print the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(netflix_df.head(5))
```
