## Background
Operations research is a broad field of study with connections to various subjects like linear algebra, graph theory, and combinatorics. Operations research is commonly associated with problems regarding optimization, such as the optimization of production schedules or resource allocation for a buisness. Many of these problems can be modeled using linear constraints and descriptive variables. The simplex algorithm is a commonly used method when solving these types of linear programming problems. It requires that the original problem be written in a *standard form* with non-negative variables and linear constraints. An *initial tableau* or matrix can then be constructed for the algorithm to operate on. The algorithm itself runs a series of *pivot operations* on cells within each tableau iteration. Pivoting requires the preformance of elementary row operations within the tableau to obtain a *pivot cell*. The simplex algorithm runs until there are no more appropriate cells to pivot, which will of course vary depending on the type of optimization and magnitude of the problem.
