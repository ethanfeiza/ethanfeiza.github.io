excerpt: "Analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank using PostgreSQL querying"

## Background
In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank using PostgreSQL querying, gaining valuable insights into the economic landscape of developing countries.

I began exploring this data set by determining which countries and distinct debt indicators were included in a particular table retrieved from the World Bank database. Using standard grouping and ordering techniques, I constructed a query with a 'total debt' field that calculated a sum of debts (combining values each debt indicator) for each country and sorted them.
