## Background

The objective of this project was to determine an optimal logistic regression model for predicting whether a patient has adult-onset diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and originally comes from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. All patients in the data set are females of Pima Indian heritage and at least 21 years old.
