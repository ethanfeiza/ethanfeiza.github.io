## Background and Analysis
This case study is from Carl Rosseel's course on DataCamp. It analyzes fictitious data from an telecom provider called Databel. Each row of the dataset represents an individual customer at Databel with 29 informative columns. More details on these fields can be found [here](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5952/datasets/060f0299a782a1bdb3fd21a801a58b03190c4163/Metadata%20-%20Case%20study_%20Analyzing%20customer%20churn%20in%20Tableau.pdf). This data comes from a snapshot of the company database at the end of a fiscal quarter, so time is not a dimension.

The story below contains four interactive tableau dashboards. Each dashboard was designed to answer particular questions from the case study regarding customer churn rate.

This case study allowed me to further explore calculated fields, level of detail expressions, dynamic zone visibility, and parameterization by analyzing the Databel dataset from scratch. I discovered how variables like Location, Age, Contract Plan, and Account Length influenced churn rate using effective data visualization strategies.
