## Background and Analysis
This case study is from Carl Rosseel's course on DataCamp. It analyzes fictitious data from an Telecom provider called Databel. Each row of the dataset represents an individual customer at Databel with 29 informative columns. More details on these fields can be found [here]([https://pages.charlotte.edu/lpsolve/](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5952/datasets/060f0299a782a1bdb3fd21a801a58b03190c4163/Metadata%20-%20Case%20study_%20Analyzing%20customer%20churn%20in%20Tableau.pdf)). This data comes from a snapshot of the company database at a certain time period, so time is not a dimension.

The first step in this case study requires an exploratory data analysis.
