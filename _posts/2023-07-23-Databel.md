## Background
This case study is from Carl Rosseel's course on DataCamp. It analyzes fictitious data from a US-based telecom provider called Databel. Each row of the dataset represents an individual customer at Databel with 29 informative columns. More details on these fields can be found [here](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5952/datasets/060f0299a782a1bdb3fd21a801a58b03190c4163/Metadata%20-%20Case%20study_%20Analyzing%20customer%20churn%20in%20Tableau.pdf). This data was collected from a report of the company database at the end of their most recent fiscal quarter. Databel needs help identifying what is driving *customer churn* at their company. Customer churn occurs when a customer ends their subscription to Databel services. *Churn rate* refers to the percentage of churned customers amongst total customers that subscribed to Databel services this past quarter.

This project allowed me to explore data visualization in Tableau while discovering data-driven insights for Databel!

## Analysis

The story below contains four interactive tableau dashboards. Each dashboard was designed to answer particular questions from the case study regarding customer churn rate.

This case study allowed me to further explore calculated fields, level of detail expressions, dynamic zone visibility, and parameterization by analyzing the Databel dataset from scratch. I discovered how variables like Location, Age, Contract Plan, and Account Length influenced churn rate using effective data visualization strategies.
