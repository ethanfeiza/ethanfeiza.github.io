## Background
This case study is from Carl Rosseel's course on DataCamp. It analyzes fictitious data from a US-based telecom provider called Databel. Each row of the dataset represents an individual customer at Databel with 29 informative columns. More details on these fields can be found [here](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5952/datasets/060f0299a782a1bdb3fd21a801a58b03190c4163/Metadata%20-%20Case%20study_%20Analyzing%20customer%20churn%20in%20Tableau.pdf). This data was collected from a report of the company database at the end of their most recent fiscal quarter. *Customer churn* occurs when a customer ends their subscription to Databel services. *Churn rate* refers to the percentage of churned customers amongst total customers that subscribed to Databel services this past quarter.

Databel needs help identifying what is driving customer churn at their company. This project allowed me to explore data visualization in Tableau while discovering data-driven insights!

## Analysis
The strategy team at Databel wanted to take a closer look at certain demographics in their customer base. The company recognizes a fine balance between service profitability and what they charge their customers. Databel has asked for some new ideas regarding where to modify costs in their data plans to reduce customer churn. The storyboard below contains four interactive tableau dashboards. Each dashboard was designed to answer the following questions.

### What are the most common reasons for churning?
Navigate to the Overview tab in the storyboard. Looking at the Churn by Category pie chart, 44.82% of churned customers left Databel last quarter due to competitor-related reasons. This is reflected in the Churn Reasons chart, where we can see that 2 of the top 3 churn reasons are in fact related to competitors. We see that 16.87% of churned customers left because a competitor made them a better offer. Similarly, 16.54% of churned customers left because a competitor had better devices.

### What is the national churn rate for Databel?
In the Overview tab, we can see that the national churn rate for Databel in the previous quarter was 26.86%.

### Which state has the highest churn rate?
Looking at the Churn by State map in the Overview tab, California had the highest churn rate out of all US states at 63.24%. This is quite high! Click on California in the Churn by State map and observe how the Churn Reasons, Churn by Category, and Customer Contract visuals change. Note that the majority of these churned customers did not provide a reason for churning. Databel could lower the California churn rate by conducting further research -- perhaps through surveying -- to discover the needs and frustrations of their Californian demographic.

### How does contract type affect the reason for churning?
The Customer Contracts pie chart in the Overview tab reveals that 51.01% of Databel's customers had month-to-month contracts last quarter. We can click on this pie slice to filter the data for these customers. Month-to-month-contract customers had a 46.29% churn rate! Of these churned customers, 45.41% of them left Databel for a competitor. One might expect lower-commitment contracts to have a greater turnover rate. This customer demographic should be a primary focus for Databel when modifying their customer policies.

### Do average monthly charges differ by customer age?
Navigate to the Age Brackets & Groups tab in the storyboard. In the purple Pick Metric filter along the top of the dashboard, select `Avg Monthly Charge`. In the Age of Customer area chart, we can see that average monthly charge (Metric) stays relatively consistent amongst all customer ages below 65. In comparison, customers aged 65+ are charged almost $10 more every month. To reduce churn rate in their elderly customers, Databel might want to consider offering a discount or senior plan to this demographic.

### How do group plans impact average monthly charges?
Currently, Databel offers a discount on group plans of 2 people or more. Group plans are incentivized by offering lower monthly charges per individual. Databel hopes this deal will draw more customers in to purchase their services. If we look at the Group Plan area chart in the Age Brackets & Groups tab, we can see that average monthly charge and churn rate decrease significantly for customers in a group. Observe that the average monthly charge per customer in any sized group is fairly uniform. We can also see a slight increase in churn rate amongst groups with 5 people. Databel might want to consider lowering average monthly charges per individual in a more linear pattern as the size of a group increases. This would further reward customers for adding more members to their group plan. In turn, this could boost customer satisfaction and decrease customer churn for this demographic. 



## Skills Applied
This case study allowed me to further explore calculated fields, level of detail expressions, dynamic zone visibility, and parameterization by analyzing the Databel dataset from scratch. I discovered how variables like Location, Age, Contract Plan, and Account Length influenced churn rate using effective data visualization strategies.
