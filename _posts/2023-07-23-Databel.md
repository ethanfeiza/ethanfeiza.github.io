## Background
This case study is from Carl Rosseel's course on DataCamp. It analyzes fictitious data from a US-based telecom provider called Databel. Each row of the dataset represents an individual customer at Databel with 29 informative columns. More details on these fields can be found [here](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5952/datasets/060f0299a782a1bdb3fd21a801a58b03190c4163/Metadata%20-%20Case%20study_%20Analyzing%20customer%20churn%20in%20Tableau.pdf). This data was collected from a report of the company database at the end of their most recent fiscal quarter. *Customer churn* occurs when a customer ends their subscription to Databel services. *Churn rate* refers to the percentage of churned customers amongst total customers that subscribed to Databel services this past quarter.

Databel needs help identifying what is driving customer churn at their company. This project allowed me to explore data visualization in Tableau while discovering data-driven insights for the company!

## Analysis

The storyboard below contains four interactive tableau dashboards. Each dashboard was designed to answer the following questions. This analysis allowed me to offer suggestions to reduce customer churn.

### What are the most common reasons for churning?
Navigate to the Overview tab in the storyboard. Looking at the Churn by Category pie chart, 44.82% of churned customers last quarter left Databel due to competitor-related reasons. This is reflected in the Churn Reasons chart, where we can see that 3 of the top 4 churn reasons are in fact related to competitors. Coming in first place, we see that 16.87% of all churned customers at Databel left because a competitor made them a better offer. Similarly, 16.54% of churned customers left because a competitor had better devices.

### What is the national churn rate for Databel?
In the Overview tab, we can see that the national churn rate for Databel in the previous quarter was 26.86%.

### Which state has the highest churn rate?
Looking at the Churn by State map, California had the highest churn rate out of all US states at 63.24%. This is quite high! Click on California in the Churn by State map and observe how the Churn Reasons, Churn by Category, and Customer Contract graphs adjust. Note that the majority of these churned customers did not provide a reason for churning. Databel could lower the Califonia churn rate by conducting further research -- perhaps through surveying -- to discover the needs and frustrations of their Californian demographic.

### How does contract type affect the reason for churning?
The Customer Contracts pie chart reveals that 51.01% of Databel's customers had month-to-month signage. We can click on this pie slice to filter the data for these customers. Month-to-month-contract customers had a 46.29% churn rate! Of these churned customers, 45.41% of them left Databel for a competitor. One might expect lower-commitment contracts to have a greater turnover rate. This customer demographic should be a main focus for Databel when they modify their customer policies.

This case study allowed me to further explore calculated fields, level of detail expressions, dynamic zone visibility, and parameterization by analyzing the Databel dataset from scratch. I discovered how variables like Location, Age, Contract Plan, and Account Length influenced churn rate using effective data visualization strategies.
