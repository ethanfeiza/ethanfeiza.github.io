## Background and Analysis
This case study is from Carl Rosseel's course on DataCamp. It analyzes fictitious data from an Telecom provider called Databel. Each row of the dataset represents an individual customer at Databel with 29 informative columns. More details on these fields can be found [here]([https://pages.charlotte.edu/lpsolve/](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5952/datasets/060f0299a782a1bdb3fd21a801a58b03190c4163/Metadata%20-%20Case%20study_%20Analyzing%20customer%20churn%20in%20Tableau.pdf)). This data comes from a snapshot of the company database at a certain time period, so time is not a dimension.

The first step in this analysis requires a brief exploration of the dataset. Creating two quick calculated fields `Number of Customers` and `Distinct Number of Customers` is an easy way to ensure that each `Customer ID` is unique. Both fields were equivalent, confirming 6687 distinct customer IDs belong to the dataset. Further, creating a calculated field `Churn Rate` revealed that 26.86% of Databel's customers had churned.
