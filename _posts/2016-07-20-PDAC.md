## Background

The purpose of this project was to identify differentially expressed genes from an over-dispersed count data set comprised of 148 PDAC tumor samples. Each tumor sample held a neoplastic cellularity percentage and count values corresponding to one of 17394 genes per sample. This project began with an analysis of the Poisson and negative binomial distributions (two common distributions used to model count data) and their effectiveness in modeling count data exhibiting overdispersion. It was determined that neither of these distributions could meet the desired accuracy of modeling this PDAC data set. Normal Quantile-Quantile plots were also constructed to visualize these inaccuracies. The Poisson-Tweedie distribution (from the 'tweedie' CRAN R package) demonstrated suitability in modeling the PDAC data set after conducting 12000+ simulated experiments testing the goodness-of-fit of estimated model parameters on over-dispersed data. An additional series of simulation studies were performed to test the empirical power of a differential-expression-test function on distinct Poisson-Tweedie distributions. This function proved to be powerful and effective in detecting differential expression between subsets in the PDAC data set. The PDAC data was split into two subsets for the first analysis. All tumor samples with low neoplastic cellularity levels (less than 0.5) were assigned to group A. The remaining tumor samples with high neoplastic cellularity levels (greater than or equal to 0.5) were assigned to group B. The second analysis focused on the explicit neoplastic cellularity values of each tumor sample. Linear regression modeling was performed on both analyses to successfully detect 1403 consensus genes from the original data supporting known prognostic markers in human cancer.
